My self-learning about machine learning

## Supervised-learning
`Supervised learning`, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process.

Two types of `supervised learning`:
- `Classification`
- `Regression`

In that repository, we introduce the completed ML project with classification like real project. 
Please look `classification` folder.
